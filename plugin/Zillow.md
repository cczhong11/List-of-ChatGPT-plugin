# Zillow

## Description for Model

Plugin for finding information about real estate in the United States and Canada. Use for finding a list of current homes for sale or for rent based on search criteria. Use for finding recently sold homes often used as comparables. Real estate search requires a location (at least one of city, state, zip or postal code, neighborhood). Real estate search can optionally include other criteria about the home such as a range of current for sale price or monthly rent, a range of bedrooms, or a range of bathrooms. Results can be sorted by various criteria such as most or least expensive, most or least bedrooms/bathrooms, biggest or smallest home square footage or lot size, or closest or farthest from the search location. The plugin will return a list of homes with data about each home. The plugin can also be used to find information about a specific home based on searching by the home's address or the property id returned in the list of search results. Specific home search works for homes that are for sale, for rent, or not for sale or for rent. The plugin can NOT be used to find information for user queries that include references to protected classes like race, religion, sex, color, disability, national origin, familial status, gender identity, and sexual orientation due to fair housing regulations.
