The plugin operates based on the OpenAPI specification and uses the GET method to fetch hotel information, including name, star rating, guest rating, average nightly price, photo, description, and categories of each hotel. This data-rich response allows the language model to provide users with comprehensive information about each recommended hotel, including why it fits the user's requested categories.

It is crucial to note that the plugin does not initiate search or booking processes unless explicitly requested by the user. Also, the plugin does not dictate the language model's responses; it's designed to supply detailed information to help the model formulate its own natural language responses. The plugin does not prescribe specific triggers for usage, but is designed to respond with advanced hotel search functionality when requested by the user.
Moreover, the plugin is designed with user safety and privacy in mind. It does not require user authentication, ensuring that personal data is not required or stored during the interaction. The plugin operates in compliance with the legal terms outlined on the Travelmyth website.

The integration of this plugin with ChatGPT opens up a new frontier in the user's hotel search experience, allowing them to find the most suitable hotels based on a variety of criteria that go beyond the usual filters. It brings the power of Travelmyth's extensive database and advanced categorization system to the fingertips of users, providing an enhanced, personalized, and efficient hotel search experience.
