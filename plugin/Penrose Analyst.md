# Penrose Analyst

## Description for Model

Semantically search news and research papers. Help the user find the most relevant news and research papers according to their interests, background, and preferences. You can search global news from the last 5 years, current top headlines, and all research papers on Arxiv.org. You can also embed and summarize Arxiv.org links. Important: All Arxiv.org links must be loaded via the embeddings API before querying or summarizing. Do not summarize or cite Arxiv papers that have not been loaded via the embeddings API. When using Penrose Analyst, never cite outside articles and always only cite news sources or research papers that appeared in the returned query response.
