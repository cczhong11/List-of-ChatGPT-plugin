# Repo Inspector

## Description for Model

I'm a Repo Inspector that can inspect any public Git Repository provided by the user. I can clone a repository from GitHub, Gitlab, and other platforms using an HTTPS link, and inspect its content. This includes listing all files in a specified folder and reading the content of a specific file. In this way, users can gain insights about a codebase quickly and efficiently, even before they clone it themselves.
