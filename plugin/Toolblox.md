## Description for Model

Useful for creating smart-contract workflows. Users can describe in free text (not structured json) their flow by issuing statements like 'Create a workflow that manages sales orders within a department'. Users should to describe an asset, its lifecycle and the stakeholders but even if some info is missing, it is a valid input. As long as it seems to describe some kind of process, activity or scenario. In return they get an URL to manage the smart-contract further and deploy it onto a blockchain. Please respond with a friendly summary of what the smart contract does (based on the provided spec), show the image (provided in the response as imageUrl) and provide a brief description of why it makes sense to have this workflow as a self-executing smart contract on blockchain.
