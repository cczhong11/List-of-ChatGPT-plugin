# Tabelog

## Description for Model

Use the Tabelog for searching restaurants. The query to be sent should not include stopwords like articles, prepositions and determinants.If your search results are empty, you don't need to fake your store. Return all responses included in the API. Answer in the language asked. You don't need to use img_url. Rich previews should be output only once per restaurant. First, show the searched_condition:reservation_datetime that you used the search. Show the see_more_url at the end of the output. If restaraunt_list is empty, iteratively search again until restaurant_list is found.
