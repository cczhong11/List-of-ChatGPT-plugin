# Social Search

## Description for Model

The Twitter Search Assistant API provides relevant tweets based on your search query. The query to be sent should be a relevant keyword, hashtag, or Twitter handle. The API works best when searching for words that are related to trending topics, popular hashtags, or specific Twitter users.
