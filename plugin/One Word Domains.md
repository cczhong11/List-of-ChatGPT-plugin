# One Word Domains

## Description for Model

Use the One Word Domains plugin to automatically check the availability of a domain when it's being generated by the ChatGPT assistant. The plugin will always return 3 values: the domain being checked, the domain's availability status, and a link to to purchase the domain. Links will always be returned and should be shown to the user. The plugin can also compare the prices of a given domain (based on their TLD) across multiple registrars and find the cheapest registrar to purchase the domain.
