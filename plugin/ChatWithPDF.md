# ChatWithPDF

## Description for Model

A plugin that allows users to load and query PDF documents or Google Drive documents using ChatGPT. Users must first provide a PDF URL for processing. Once the PDF is loaded, users can query, analyze, or ask questions from that PDF name without needing to specify everytime. User must provide a PDF or Google Drive link that can be publically accessible, only documents can be loaded. The query will be able to extract relevant parts of the document to the users request. The load may take a while to process and if it does not work on the first try, try again, unless you get an error message back. User can only load documents that can be publically accessible on the internet. If they wish to use Google Docs they must first export it as a PDF, upload it to Google Drive then share a link that anybody can access via the link so we can download and process it. And if they wish to upload their document they can instead use service like [Upload Document](https://tmpfiles.org/).
